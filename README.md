### Architectural Overview
// TODO: Add image



### Scenarios (Acceptance Criteria)

``` 
Given application has internet connection
When user launches the application
Application look and feel (identity) is the latest selection
System requests list of identities for further use
```

``` 
Given application has NO internet connection
When user launches the application
Application look and feel (identity) is the latest selection
```

``` 
Given application has internet connection
And user launches the application, navigates to identity list
And taps on any identity
Application look and feel (identity) changes to newly selected identity
```
