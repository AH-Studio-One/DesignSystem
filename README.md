### Scenarios (Acceptance Criteria)

``` Given application has internet connection
When user launches the application
Application look and feel (identity) is the latest selection
System requests list of identities for further use
```

``` Given application has NO internet connection
When user launches the application
Application look and feel (identity) is the latest selection
```

``` Given application has internet connection
And user launches the application and navigates to identity list
Application look and feel (identity) is the latest selection
System requests list of identities for further use
```

``` Given application has internet connection
And user launches the application and navigates to identity list
And taps on any identity
Application look and feel (identity) changes to newly selected identity
